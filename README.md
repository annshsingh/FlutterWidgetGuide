A flutter appliction listing all the widgets covered in [Flutter widget of the week playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG)

## About
I created this project to improve my skills with dart and flutter as a development platform. I am used to developing native android apps so I'll be focusing on designing this project for android platform.</br> 
This project might help you to learn about Flutter if you are a beginner in this space.</br>
My experience with flutter has been great thus far.</br> 
I hope you like it too.
</br>The project is developed in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) language.</br>
All the files are listed in the [/lib](https://github.com/annshsingh/flutter-widget-guide/tree/master/lib) folder.</br>
